# nodejs_installation

# To install any version of Node.js you can use a PPA (personal package archive) which is maintained by Nodesource. These PPAs have a lot more versions of Nodejs as compared to the official Ubuntu repositories. First, we will need to install the PPA in order to install Node.js 16. From your home directory
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo bash -

# With the repository added successfully, you can now install Node.js 16 on Ubuntu 22.04/20.04/18.04 with the command:
    sudo apt -y install nodejs
